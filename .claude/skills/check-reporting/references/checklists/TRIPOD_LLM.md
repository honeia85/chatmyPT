## Naming and scope (read first)

- TRIPOD-LLM is an **extension** of the **TRIPOD** family (TRIPOD 2015 → TRIPOD+AI 2024 →
  TRIPOD-LLM 2025). In Methods, name **both** the base instrument and the extension and cite each
  (manuscript-style-classical §14): "reported per TRIPOD (Collins et al. 2015) and its large-language-model
  extension TRIPOD-LLM (Gallifant et al. 2025)."
- **Applies to** studies that develop, fine-tune, prompt, or evaluate **large language models** for a
  biomedical/clinical task (classification, extraction, summarization, generation, question
  answering, etc.) — not only to risk-prediction models.
- **Pairs with, does not replace, MI-CLEAR-LLM** (the 6-item LLM-accuracy supplement). Apply
  MI-CLEAR-LLM alongside when LLM accuracy is an outcome.

## Notes for Assessors

- The numbering follows the official TRIPOD-LLM scheme (19 main items, ~50 subitems). Use the
  official interactive checklist for the submission form and the separate TRIPOD-LLM-for-Abstracts
  sub-checklist (item 2).
- **Version reporting (item 6a) is non-waivable** for an LLM study: a result tied to an unnamed or
  undated model snapshot is not reproducible. Mark MISSING if the exact version/access date is absent.
- **Leakage/contamination (item 5b)** is the LLM-specific analogue of train–test separation:
  evaluation data must not have entered pretraining, fine-tuning, or prompt-development. Probe explicitly.
- **Human evaluation (item 7d)** that drives a quality claim needs a rubric with anchors, rater
  expertise, blinding, and inter-rater agreement — a bare "two physicians reviewed the outputs" is PARTIAL.
- Task-specific items (Prompting 9, Summarization 10, Instruction-tuning 11, Results-participants 16)
  are **N/A** when the component is absent — record a one-line justification rather than a blank.
- TRIPOD-LLM is a **living guideline**; confirm the current item set at the source before a formal
  submission checklist, and pair with MI-CLEAR-LLM when LLM accuracy is an evaluated outcome.
