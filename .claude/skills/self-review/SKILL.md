# Self-Review Skill

You are helping a medical researcher check their own manuscript before journal submission.
The goal is to anticipate reviewer comments by applying the same critical lens used in
peer review across medical journals.

This is NOT about writing a review. It's about producing an actionable list of
anticipated reviewer comments with specific fix suggestions, so the manuscript can be
strengthened before reviewers ever see it.

## Optional Flags

- `--fix`: After generating the review report, automatically apply fixes for all issues where `fixable_by_ai` is true. Edits the manuscript in place, then reports a diff summary. Does NOT fix issues marked `fixable_by_ai: false` (e.g., missing data, design flaws). Maximum 2 fix-and-re-review iterations.
- `--json`: Output the structured JSON block (see Phase 3c below) in addition to the markdown report. Default when called from `/write-paper` Phase 7.
- `--panel`: Run the multi-agent panel review (Phase 2.6) — several domain-expert reviewers in parallel plus an editor synthesis — instead of the single-pass review. Opt-in and **off by default** (a panel spawns N reviewer agents + 1 editor, so it costs several times more tokens). Reserve it for a high-stakes pre-submission final pass on a top-tier target. Do **not** combine with `--fix`: a panel diagnoses and prioritizes; run `--fix` as a separate follow-up pass once the author has triaged the panel's findings.

## Severity Framing

When flagging issues, classify severity:
- **Fatal**: Fundamental design flaw that cannot be fixed with existing data (e.g., data leakage
  that invalidates all results, absence of any reference standard, label-feature circularity).
  The manuscript likely needs redesign. Submission would likely result in Reject.
- **Fixable**: Significant but addressable with existing data (e.g., missing calibration analysis,
  unclear exclusion criteria, absent CIs, incomplete reporting). These are the most actionable findings.

Most issues are Fixable. Reserve Fatal for true design-level problems.

## Two Objectives: the Floor and the Ceiling

A submission-ready manuscript optimizes **two** things at once, and most of this skill (and
the gate stack behind it) only optimizes the first:

- **Floor — minimize rejection-for-cause.** Fabricated citations, numbers that do not
  reconcile, overclaims, missing checklist items, leakage. Categories A–K and the
  deterministic gates (Phases 2.5–2.5f) do this, and they are right to. Many of them raise the
  floor by **adding** material: a hedge, a caveat, a disclosure, an audit trail, a checklist row.
- **Ceiling — maximize editorial-championing.** Will a handling editor read a *confident
  narrative* (problem → design → result → meaning) and want to send it out, or a *defensive
  audit* and bounce it? Nothing in the floor stack pushes here, and several floor gates push the
  other way. Iterated, a manuscript over-hardens: every individual gate finding is correct, yet
  the **accumulated** product reads as a rebuttal letter — over-hedged, audit-trail-heavy,
  Abstract buried under caveats, the strongest sensitivity result hidden in Limitations, too long.

These objectives can conflict, so the order matters: **the floor gates run first and secure
accuracy; then the ceiling pass (category L / Phase 2.5g) reads the accurate manuscript as a
whole and recommends SUBTRACTION — REMOVE, MOVE, or TIGHTEN — so the same content is read
confidently.** The ceiling pass is advisory and never blocks; it cannot relax a floor gate.
Without it, repeated self-review monotonically over-defends. Surface the ceiling findings as
their own first-class output (Phase 3), not folded silently into the "add this" comments.

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Intake

1. Get the manuscript -- PDF, Word doc, or pasted text.
2. Ask the user:
   - Target journal? (affects reporting standards and scope expectations)
   - Manuscript type? (original research / review / technical note / letter / meta-analysis / case report)
   - Anything they're already worried about?
   - **Review depth?** The default is a single-pass review. For a high-stakes pre-submission final pass, a multi-agent **panel** (`--panel`, Phase 2.6) is available — several domain-expert reviewers run independently, then an editor consolidates them (more thorough, but it spawns several agents so it costs several times more tokens). On an interactive run, surface this option **once** in one line and offer it; then proceed with the single-pass review unless the user opts in. Do **not** surface or auto-apply the panel when invoked with `--json` or from `/write-paper` — those stay single-pass.
3. Read the full manuscript.
4. **SSOT gate — confirm there is one manuscript, not several.** Self-review reads a single
   input file, so a divergence between a legacy working copy and the live submission copy is
   structurally invisible to it. Before a `--panel` run (or any pre-submission pass), check for
   multiple copies and reconcile first:

   ```bash
   find . \( -path '*manuscript*' -o -path '*main_document*' \) -name '*.md' | grep -v node_modules
   ```

   If more than one manuscript-like file exists, confirm which is the SSOT and run
   `/sync-submission`'s divergence gate before reviewing — a `STALE_COPY` (an SSOT numeric claim
   or heading that did not propagate to the other copy) is a P0 that must clear first:

   ```bash
   python3 "${MEDSCI_SKILLS_ROOT:-$HOME/workspace/medsci-skills}/skills/sync-submission/scripts/detect_copy_divergence.py" \
     --ssot <ssot>.md --copy <other-copy>.md
   ```

   Review the SSOT copy; do not review a stale copy and pass it.

   **In `--panel` mode this is a blocking precondition, not advice.** A panel spawns N reviewer
   agents + an editor, so reviewing a stale copy wastes the whole pass (a prior panel's top
   finding was literally "you reviewed the wrong file"). If the `find` above returns **more than
   one** manuscript-like `.md` and the SSOT is not pinned — no `SSOT.yaml` with `truth.manuscript_md`
   and no explicit `--ssot <path>` argument — **STOP before spawning any reviewer** and have the
   user name the SSOT (and clear any `STALE_COPY`). Do not auto-pick the longest/newest file. The
   single-pass review may proceed on the one file it was given, but the panel must not.

### Phase 2: Systematic Check

Run the manuscript through each applicable category below. For each item, assess whether
a reviewer would raise it as a Major or Minor comment.

Use the Research-Type Adaptation table (below) to determine which categories apply fully,
partially, or not at all for the given manuscript type.

#### A. Study Design & Data Integrity

| Check | What to look for |
|-------|-----------------|
| Patient-level splitting | Are train/val/test splits at the patient level? Is this explicitly stated? |
| Leakage risk | Any postoperative variable used in a preoperative model? Cohort-wide preprocessing before split? |
| Input-text contamination | For NLP/LLM extraction tasks, does any supplied report text (clinical history, indication, impression, prior diagnosis, referral text) already contain the target label? If yes, mark as Major unless the input was masked or a no-leaky-field sensitivity analysis is reported. |
| Temporal independence | Random split within same institution = no temporal independence. Acknowledged? |
| Analysis unit clarity | Patient vs exam vs lesion vs image -- is the unit consistent throughout? |
| Sample size per class | For the test set specifically -- are there enough cases per class for stable metrics? |

#### B. Reference Standard & Ground Truth

| Check | What to look for |
|-------|-----------------|
| Definition specificity | Is the reference standard precisely defined? (e.g., "pathological T stage" vs vague "staging") |
| Timing | Interval between index test and reference standard reported? |
| Independence | Were ground truth annotators independent from the comparator readers? |
| Annotation protocol | Number of readers, consensus method, blinding, inter-reader agreement reported? |

#### C. Validation & Statistical Reporting

| Check | What to look for |
|-------|-----------------|
| Confidence intervals | All primary metrics have 95% CIs? |
| Calibration **[CRITICAL]** | Prediction models: calibration plot + Brier score or slope/intercept MUST be present. AUC alone is insufficient -- mark as Major if absent |
| Clinical comparator | Is there a clinical-only baseline to show incremental value? |
| DCA / net benefit | For clinical decision tools: decision curve analysis present? |
| Fine-tuning baseline | For LLM/NLP fine-tuning, LoRA, prompt-engineering, or multi-agent claims, is there a same-backbone zero-shot or few-shot comparator on the same input, schema, and test split? |
| Multiple comparisons | If many tests: acknowledged as exploratory, or correction applied? |
| Paired statistics | If same patients compared across modalities: paired tests used (McNemar, DeLong)? |
| Effect-size meaningfulness | Scored separately from significance: is each primary effect (OR, HR, beta, Cohen's d, correlation) translated to a real-world unit shift and compared to a minimal clinically important difference? Is significance driven by magnitude rather than sample size? |
| Power-aware null interpretation | Scored separately from significance, for any **non-significant primary result** (p > 0.05, 95% CI crossing the null): is the analysis powered to *exclude* a clinically meaningful effect? An underpowered null is "not yet established," not "no effect" -- if the upper CI bound still includes a meaningful effect size, a flat "X was not associated with Y" claim overreads the data. Look for reported observed power or a minimum detectable effect that justifies a negative conclusion, and watch for **bilateral over-correction** (a prior "independently associated" overclaim swinging to an equally unsupported "not associated" claim during revision). Undocumented null = Minor; a null that drives a clinical recommendation or a headline negative conclusion without power/CI-compatibility justification = Major. |
| Equivalence-margin discipline | A claim that two groups/methods are "equivalent," "non-inferior," "indistinguishable," or show "no difference" requires a **pre-stated margin** — a TOST procedure, or the CI compared against a declared MCID. Grep `indistinguishable\|equivalent\|non-inferior\|no difference` and check for an adjacent `margin\|TOST\|MCID\|non-inferiority`; a margin-free equivalence claim is a Major (it converts a failure to reject into positive evidence of no effect). |
| Interaction-anchor discipline | When synergy / interaction / effect-modification **is** the research question, the null must be anchored to the **interaction parameter** (a likelihood-ratio test of the interaction term, or the interaction OR/HR on one consistent scale), not to a main-effect OR whose upper CI is then read as "no synergy." Grep `synergy\|interaction\|joint effect\|effect modification`; if present, confirm Results carries an `OR_int\|β_int\|LRT\|p_interaction` term. A synergy conclusion resting on a main-effect estimate is a model mis-specification (Major), even when each main effect is individually correct. |
| Difference-in-significance discipline | A between-group claim that an association is "more X / stronger / more pronounced in group A than group B" must rest on a **formal interaction test**, not on group A being significant (p < 0.05) while group B is not (p = NS). The difference between "significant" and "non-significant" is **not** itself significant. Grep `more (clearly\|strongly\|pronounced)\|stronger in\|(only\|chiefly) in (men\|women\|older\|younger\|the [A-Za-z]+ subgroup)` near two stratum-specific estimates with discordant p-values; if no interaction term (`p_interaction\|OR_int\|LRT`) is reported for that contrast, flag it (difference-in-significance fallacy). A subgroup-difference conclusion built this way is a Major; the fix is to report the interaction test or soften to "associations were observed in group A; the interaction was not formally tested." |

#### D. Clinical Framing & Importance

| Check | What to look for |
|-------|-----------------|
| Intended use | Is the clinical decision point clearly stated? (triage vs diagnosis vs prognosis vs monitoring) |
| Overclaiming | Does language match evidence? ("will improve" -> "may potentially"; "superior" with overlapping CIs?) |
| Terminology precision | Key terms defined? (e.g., "perioperative" = when exactly?) |
| Title-content alignment | Does the title accurately reflect what was actually done? |
| Novelty statement | What does this study add beyond existing literature? Is this explicitly stated? |
| Substantive novelty differentiation | For AI/LLM extraction papers, does the Introduction name 2-3 close prior papers/systems and state the concrete delta (new task, dataset, workflow, method, validation, or clinical decision point), rather than merely saying the method is novel? |
| Clinical importance | Would the findings change clinical practice or research direction? Is this articulated? |
| Decision impact | Does the manuscript state what decision, workflow step, or downstream action would change if the model is correct? A text-only phenotype that does not alter triage, treatment, surveillance, enrichment, or research operations has weak clinical utility even if accuracy is high. |
| Added value / actionability | Scored separately from novelty: does the finding add value over a measure already in routine use, or is it "real but redundant" (restates a standard test)? At the typical effect size, would a clinician act on it for an individual? |
| Endpoint↔conclusion scope **[CRITICAL]** | Does the conclusion's *action* exceed what the design or endpoint supports? A cross-sectional / single-visit study cannot license a prognostic or surveillance claim (rescreen interval, disease progression); a binary surrogate endpoint (present/absent, >0) is risk stratification, not a care directive (defer/withhold/initiate therapy). Both are documented anti-patterns. |

Run the deterministic scope gate:

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/check_scope_coherence.py" \
  --manuscript manuscript.md --out qc/scope_coherence.json --strict
```

`CROSS_SECTIONAL_PROGNOSTIC` and `SURROGATE_CARE_DIRECTIVE` are Anticipated Major Comments (category: D. Clinical Framing). `CROSS_SECTIONAL_YIELD_LANGUAGE` is an Anticipated **Minor** Comment — a cross-sectional / prevalence design using incidence-flavored screening vocabulary ("yield", "detection rate", "number-needed-to-screen/image", "rescreen interval") without defining "yield" once as cross-sectional report-positive prevalence. The gate is conservative — it fires only when a design/endpoint signal and a conclusion-region action verb (or the yield lexicon) co-occur.

#### E. Reproducibility

| Check | What to look for |
|-------|-----------------|
| Preprocessing details | All steps listed in order? Normalization, augmentation, resampling specified? |
| Model details | Architecture, optimizer, LR, batch size, epochs, early stopping reported? |
| Segmentation protocol | ROI definition, reader experience, blinding, tool used? |
| Hardware/software | Inference environment, software versions, code availability? |
| Scanner/protocol info | For imaging studies: scanner model, sequence parameters, contrast protocol? |
| Data/code availability | Is a data availability statement included? Code shared or reason for not sharing stated? |

#### F. Reporting Completeness

| Check | What to look for |
|-------|-----------------|
| Abstract-body consistency | Numbers in Abstract match Tables/Results? |
| Table/Figure accuracy | Cross-check key values between tables, figures, and text |
| Follow-up duration | For survival/prognosis: median follow-up with IQR reported? |
| Ethics | All participating institutions' IRB approval documented? Patient consent described? |
| Missing data | Handling of incomplete cases described? |
| CONSORT/STARD/TRIPOD flow | Appropriate flow diagram present with patient counts at each step? |
| Body word count vs journal cap | Is the body within the target journal's word limit? A revise loop monotonically adds words and silently breaches the cap. Run `/sync-submission` `scripts/check_wordcount_cap.py` (`--journal-profile` or `--limit`; the binding number is the rendered DOCX count). Over cap → Major; within 0.95× → Minor (a further pass will likely breach). |
| Funding & COI | Funding sources and competing interests disclosed? |

#### G. Reporting Guideline Compliance

Match the manuscript type to the appropriate checklist and verify key items:

| Manuscript type | Checklist | Critical items to verify |
|----------------|-----------|------------------------|
| Diagnostic accuracy | STARD / STARD-AI | Flow diagram, reference standard, spectrum |
| Prediction model (non-AI) | TRIPOD 2015 | Model development vs validation, calibration, missing data |
| Prediction model (AI/ML) | TRIPOD+AI 2024 | Model development vs validation, calibration, leakage, fairness |
| AI / Radiomics | CLAIM 2024 / CLEAR | Feature selection transparency, external validation |
| RCT | CONSORT / CONSORT-AI | Randomization, blinding, ITT |
| Systematic review (interventions) | PRISMA 2020 | Search strategy, screening, risk of bias |
| Meta-analysis (observational) | MOOSE + PRISMA 2020 | Confounding assessment, heterogeneity, publication bias |
| Observational | STROBE | Confounding, selection bias, missing data |
| Reliability / agreement | GRRAS | ICC model/type, rater description, measurement protocol |
| Educational | SQUIRE 2.0 | Intervention description, outcome measures, context |
| Case report | CARE | Timeline, diagnostic reasoning, informed consent |
| Surgical | STROBE-Surgery | Surgeon experience, technique details, complications |

For a full item-by-item audit, run `/check-reporting` on this manuscript. If it has already
been run, reference its results and flag any MISSING items as Anticipated Major/Minor Comments.
If not yet run, flag: "Full reporting guideline compliance not yet audited -- run `/check-reporting`
before submission for item-level assessment."

#### H. Circularity

| Check | What to look for |
|-------|-----------------|
| Label-feature overlap | Is the prediction label derived from the same data source as any input features? (e.g., NLP-extracted label + text-derived features from same reports) |
| Tautological prediction | Does the model predict something that is already encoded in its inputs? |
| Circular validation | Is the validation set constructed using information from the training process? |

#### I. Protocol Heterogeneity

| Check | What to look for |
|-------|-----------------|
| Multi-site acquisition | If multi-site: are scanner models, protocols, and acquisition parameters reported per site? |
| Harmonization | For imaging or lab features: was harmonization applied (ComBat, z-scoring)? If not, acknowledged? |
| Temporal protocol drift | For longitudinal data: did acquisition protocols change over the study period? |

#### J. Method Transparency

| Check | What to look for |
|-------|-----------------|
| Model provenance | Is it clear where the model came from? (in-house vs vendor-provided vs open-source) |
| Training vs fine-tuning | If pre-trained: was the model fine-tuned on study data? If vendor-provided: any access to training data composition? |
| Proprietary limitations | For commercial AI or tools: are known limitations acknowledged? Can results be independently reproduced? |
| Classical-style body conventions | Does the body carry an AI tell or a policy violation a senior reviewer flags on sight — a `§` symbol, an in-body AI-disclosure paragraph, eligibility criteria as prose, mixed OR/HR decimal places, or em-dash overuse? |

Run the deterministic classical-style lint (these are all greps, so they belong in a gate, not eyeballing):

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/check_classical_style.py" \
  --manuscript manuscript.md --out qc/classical_style.json --strict
```

`SECTION_SYMBOL` and `INBODY_AI_DISCLOSURE` are Major (the `§` count must be 0; the AI-disclosure paragraph belongs on the title page for a classical / senior-MA target, not the body). `ELIGIBILITY_PROSE`, `DECIMAL_INCONSISTENCY`, and `EM_DASH_OVERUSE` are Minor. This is the self-review-side mirror of `/write-paper` Step 7.1's classical QC (manuscript-style-classical §5/§6/§7/§8).

#### K. Reviewer-team consistency (SR/MA-only; fabrication-grade)

| Check | What to look for |
|-------|-----------------|
| DUAL vs SINGLE conjunction **[CRITICAL]** | Methods or PROSPERO claims dual independent reviewers AND Discussion/Limitations admits single primary reviewer + 20% sample (or "deferred to before submission")? Mark as **MAJOR**, fabrication-grade. |
| LLM-as-reviewer **[CRITICAL]** | A per-study extraction JSON whose `reviewer`/`screener`/`extractor` field is an LLM (Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, "LLM")? An LLM is a tool, not an independent reviewer — listing it as one misrepresents the team. **Fatal**, regardless of the prose. |
| Deferred mitigation | A future-tense mitigation promise — "a 20% sample **will be completed before submission**" — unmet at circulation? The future tense is the tell that the work is not done. **MAJOR**. |

Run the deterministic check at Phase 2 entry (pass the extraction JSON — a file or
a directory of per-study JSONs — so the prose↔JSON↔confession 3-way is covered):

```bash
python "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/check_reviewer_team_consistency.py" \
    --manuscript manuscript.md \
    --prospero prospero/record.md \
    --extraction-json extraction/ \
    --out _audit_self/reviewer_team_consistency.md
```

Exit 1 = MAJOR red flag. The JSON sidecar carries `dual_hits`, `single_hits`,
`llm_reviewer_hits`, and `deferred_mitigation_hits`. Any of the DUAL+SINGLE
conjunction, an LLM reviewer field, or a deferred mitigation trips it. Either of
the dual/single claims alone is fine; the conjunction is read by reviewers as
fabrication. Resolution path:
1. Honest Methods/PROSPERO update (single-reviewer execution disclosed), OR
2. Limitations confession rewritten if dual review was actually completed.

#### L. Editorial impression & defensiveness (advisory; the counterweight)

This is the **ceiling** category (see "Two Objectives" above) and the inverse of the floor
gates: where A–K and the numerical gates ask "what is missing or wrong?" (and answer by
**adding**), L asks "does the accurate manuscript read confidently, or has it over-defended?"
(and answers by **subtracting**). Every L finding is **advisory (Minor / impression) and
non-blocking** — it never converts to a Major and never blocks submission. The fixes are
REMOVE / MOVE / TIGHTEN, not "add a caveat."

| Check | What to look for | Action |
|-------|-----------------|--------|
| Hedge density | Defensive-caveat tokens stacking up per 1,000 narrative words — the prose hedges faster than it asserts. Keep the load-bearing caveats; cut the reflexive ones. | TIGHTEN |
| Repeated caveat | The same caveat motif ("no deployable claim", "not generalizable", "hypothesis-generating") repeated across body + Abstract. Say it once, firmly. | TIGHTEN |
| Audit minutiae in body | Provenance tokens (SHA / git commit / unit-test / post-lock timeline / manifest / seed=N / audit trail) in the Introduction / Results / Discussion narrative. Reproducibility detail belongs in a Methods statement or a supplement. | MOVE |
| Limitations volume | A Limitations passage that enumerates a long list of discrete items reads as a rebuttal letter; consolidate related items. | TIGHTEN |
| Abstract caveat load | The Abstract carries several caveat clauses, burying the headline result before a reader reaches it. Lead with the result; keep one or two essential qualifiers. | TIGHTEN |
| Buried defense | A strong numeric robustness / sensitivity result sitting only in Limitations or the supplement, with no robustness mention in Results. Promote it into Results — it is *evidence for* the finding, not a caveat against it. (The inverse of the scope-coherence gate, which pushes a *weak* analysis out of Results.) | MOVE |

Run the deterministic gate (Phase 2.5g) rather than eyeballing it — these are all counts and placements:

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/check_editorial_impression.py" \
  --manuscript manuscript.md --out qc/editorial_impression.json
```

`HEDGE_DENSITY`, `HEDGE_REPEAT`, `AUDIT_IN_BODY`, `LIMITATIONS_VOLUME`, `ABSTRACT_CAVEAT_LOAD`,
and `BURIED_DEFENSE` are Anticipated **Minor** Comments (category: L. Editorial impression),
each carrying a REMOVE / MOVE / TIGHTEN `action`. The gate never blocks (it has no Major and
exits 0 even under `--strict`); thresholds are tunable (`--hedge-per-1k`, `--repeat-threshold`,
`--limitations-max`, `--abstract-caveat-max`). It is conservative — each probe fires only on an
explicit, locatable signal.

*Meta-analysis: Replace C with heterogeneity assessment (I-squared, prediction intervals),
publication bias (funnel plot, Egger), and sensitivity/subgroup analyses.

**Type-Specific Additional Checks:**

- **Observational studies**: Confounding assessment (DAG or adjustment strategy), selection bias, exposure measurement validity. Run **Phase 2.5e (Confounding Completeness)** and apply the O1–O18 probes in `references/domain-probes/observational_confounding.md` — including O7 (over-adjustment: do not adjust for a consequence/mediator of the outcome, e.g. serum uric acid in an eGFR model — the opposite-direction failure to O1), O8 (analysis unit & clustering — run `check_cohort_arithmetic.py --id-col` for records-vs-subjects), O9 (construct validity of a report-/registry-derived outcome), O10 (an inferential effect-size gradient across overlapping/nested subsets needs a difference/interaction test, not descriptive refinement alone), and — for complex-survey data (NHANES/KNHANES/CHNS) — O11 (design-based weighting: the right weight + strata + PSU, subpopulation-not-subset) and O12 (data-driven inflection-point/'saturation' threshold mining needs a breakpoint CI + pre-specification, not a quoted cutoff), O13 (a cross-sectional mediation claim cannot establish X→M→Y order and needs an unmeasured-M–Y-confounding sensitivity), and O14 (a synergy/joint-effect/effect-modification claim needs the additive scale — RERI/AP/S with CIs — not a multiplicative-only interaction or joint-category ORs), O15 (an analytic cohort selected on an optional modality/procedure's availability is a spectrum/selection bias, not a generalizability caveat — ask for consecutive enrollment + a selected-vs-source comparison), and O16 (a serial-imaging size/growth endpoint needs a stated lesion-tracking rule + multiplicity prevalence + a solitary-lesion sensitivity), O17 (a many-exposure agnostic scan — ExWAS/EWAS/MWAS — needs multiplicity control against the true denominator + independent replication, not a raw p<0.05 top hit), and O18 (a multi-rater agreement / reader test run on pooled pairwise distances rather than independent subjects is pseudoreplication — re-run per-subject). If the manuscript develops or compares a **clinical prediction model** (TRIPOD / TRIPOD+AI, nested predictor-set comparison), also apply the CP1–CP4 probes in `references/domain-probes/clinical_prediction_model.md` (apparent-vs-optimism-corrected calibration/DCA, the incremental-value-vs-marginal-effect two-null distinction, EPV per nested model, net benefit as model comparison not policy).
- **Educational studies**: Learning outcome measurement validity, Kirkpatrick level, control group adequacy, curriculum fidelity
- **Meta-analyses**: Search comprehensiveness (2+ databases), screening reproducibility (2 reviewers), RoB assessment per study, GRADE certainty
- **Case reports**: Diagnostic reasoning transparency, timeline completeness, informed consent, generalizability disclaimer
- **Surgical studies**: Learning curve consideration, surgeon volume/experience, complication grading (Clavien-Dindo), operative detail completeness

**Domain probe modules (load when the manuscript type matches):**

These modules carry the same domain-specific critique probes used by `/peer-review`, vendored here so self-review reaches the same depth (in particular, survival/time-to-event manuscripts now get a dedicated probe set that the routing table above does not otherwise cover).

| Manuscript type / signal | Probe module |
|---|---|
| Systematic Review / Meta-Analysis | `references/domain-probes/sr_ma.md` (P0–P19) |
| Time-to-event / survival / prognostic model (Cox, Fine-Gray, DeepSurv, nomogram, risk-stratification cutoff) | `references/domain-probes/survival_prognostic.md` (S1–S9) |
| Radiomic feature reproducibility / acquisition-parameter sweep / reliability-based feature filtering | `references/domain-probes/radiomics.md` (R1–R4) |
| Cross-modality image synthesis (MRI→PET / MRI→CT / non-contrast→contrast / low-dose→full-dose) claiming functional/molecular information or target-modality substitution | `references/domain-probes/image_synthesis.md` (IS1–IS4) |
| Narrative / review article / primer / state-of-the-art | `references/domain-probes/narrative_review.md` (RV1–RV9) |
| AI/ML primary study with a clinical claim (generalizable / outperforms clinicians / deployment-ready / can replace a reader) | `references/domain-probes/ai_overclaiming.md` (AO0–AO7) |
| Engineer-built medical-imaging model (segmentation / classification / detection; CNN / U-Net / nnU-Net / transformer) being validated — partition/leakage, seed & run variance, metric selection, reproducibility, reference-standard quality | `references/domain-probes/model_development.md` (MD0–MD8) |
| LLM / MLLM evaluated on a clinical task (radiology report generation, visual question answering, clinical text extraction/classification; closed API or open weights) | `references/domain-probes/mllm_evaluation.md` (ME0–ME8) |
| Randomised controlled trial (parallel / crossover / cluster / stepped-wedge) | `references/domain-probes/rct_trial.md` (RC0–RC7) |
| Diagnostic test accuracy (DTA) primary study / multi-reader multi-case (MRMC) reader study (index test vs reference standard, AI-vs-reader, modality comparison) | `references/domain-probes/diagnostic_accuracy.md` (D1–D11) |
| Case report / case series / single-patient clinical narrative (incl. adverse-event/pharmacovigilance and imaging-led radiology/nuclear-medicine/IR reports) | `references/domain-probes/case_report.md` (CR1–CR9) |
| AI/ML, prediction, or diagnostic study claiming cross-population performance (generalizable / deployment-ready / "works for patients"), or presenting subgroup analyses as a fairness/equity argument | `references/domain-probes/equity_fairness.md` (EQ0–EQ6) |
| Mendelian randomization (genetic variants as instrumental variables: two-sample summary-data, one-sample, multivariable MR, drug-target / cis-MR, non-linear MR) | `references/domain-probes/mendelian_randomization.md` (MR1–MR8) |
| Polygenic risk score / polygenic score (PRS / PGS) developed, validated, or applied as a predictor or risk-stratifier | `references/domain-probes/polygenic_risk_score.md` (PG1–PG8) |

| Qualitative study (interviews, focus groups, ethnography, grounded theory, phenomenology, document analysis; reflexivity, trustworthiness, thematic analysis — not quantitative validity) | `references/domain-probes/qualitative_research.md` (QL1–QL8) |

For a **classifier / NLP / tabular ML** manuscript, also run the deterministic feature-selection-leakage gate — a data-driven selection (feature selection, log-odds / univariate filtering, vocabulary construction, a threshold) fit on the FULL dataset before cross-validation inflates the CV metric:

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/check_cv_leakage.py" \
  --manuscript manuscript.md --out qc/cv_leakage.json
```

`CV_SELECTION_LEAKAGE` (Major) fires when a selection token co-occurs with cross-validation and no fold-nesting is disclosed ("within each fold" / "nested CV" suppresses it). This is distinct from patient-vs-image split leakage (`model-validation/check_split_leakage.py`).

When the manuscript matches a row, read `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/domain-probes/<module>.md` and apply each probe as an additional source of Anticipated Major / Minor Comments. The module severity words (MAJOR / MINOR) map to this skill's framing as follows: a conclusion-threatening or design-level finding becomes a **Fatal** Anticipated Major Comment, a reporting-level finding becomes a **Fixable** Anticipated Minor Comment, and each is tagged with the closest category letter (A–K). These probes **complement** categories A–K above; they do not replace them. (The modules are vendored byte-identical from `/peer-review`; do not edit one copy only — run `python3 scripts/check_domain_probe_sync.py --sync`.)

### Phase 2.5: Numerical Cross-Verification (Internal)

Before generating the report, verify internal consistency:

1. **Abstract vs Body**: Do all numbers in the Abstract match the Results section and Tables?
2. **Table vs Text**: Cross-check key metrics (sample sizes, primary outcomes, p-values) between tables and narrative text.
3. **Figure vs Text**: Do figure legends match the data described in Results?
4. **Percentage arithmetic**: Verify that n/N percentages are calculated correctly (e.g., 23/150 = 15.3%, not 15.0%).
5. **CI plausibility**: Do confidence intervals seem reasonable given sample sizes?
6. **Rate back-calculation**: every reported rate must invert to its own numerator/denominator — an incidence rate ≈ events / person-years × scale (±rounding). A rate that does not recompute from the stated events and person-time (or that implies more events than the cohort can supply) is a Major, not a Minor.
7. **Exclusion-cascade and complete-case arithmetic** (cohort/observational): the STROBE flow must balance — start N − Σ(exclusions) == final analytic N — and any complete-case statement must balance — total − missing == complete. A footnote N that does not equal the subtraction is a Major.

For cohort/observational manuscripts, run the deterministic gate instead of eyeballing it (it parses prose equations + GFM tables, and recomputes from a committed CSV when given one):

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/check_cohort_arithmetic.py" \
  --manuscript manuscript.md --data analysis/cohort.csv --id-col mockid \
  --out qc/cohort_arithmetic.json --strict
```

`RATE_BACKCALC` / `CASCADE_SUM` / `PARTITION_OVERLAP` rows are Anticipated Major Comments (category: A. Study Design & Data Integrity); the partition check is the Phase 2.5b cohort branch below. Pass `--id-col` (or let it auto-detect a subject-ID column) on health-screening / EMR / registry data so the gate also runs the **analysis-unit** check: when `records > unique subjects` and the manuscript states neither the analysis unit nor a one-record-per-subject sensitivity, it emits `ANALYSIS_UNIT_UNDISCLOSED` (Major — non-independent observations give anti-conservative CIs; probe O8). Flag any remaining internal-consistency discrepancies as Anticipated Minor Comments (category: F. Reporting Completeness).

### Phase 2.5a: Numerical Source-Fidelity Audit (External)

Internal consistency (Phase 2.5) is necessary but not sufficient. Numbers can be fully self-
consistent across Abstract / Table / Text and still be wrong at the source — a single
transcription error propagates cleanly through every downstream stage.

Also run the **displayed-arithmetic** gate — a stated difference must equal the subtraction of
its two displayed component values at the SAME precision:

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/check_rounded_delta.py" \
  --manuscript manuscript.md --out qc/rounded_delta.json
```

`ROUNDED_DELTA_MISMATCH` (Minor) fires when e.g. AUCs are shown as `0.70` and `0.73` (a displayed
gap of 0.03) while the between-arm difference is stated as `0.02` — self-consistent only on the
unrounded values. Fix: report components and the delta at one precision, or footnote that the delta
is computed on unrounded values. A higher-precision component pair (`0.703` vs `0.726`) with a 2-dp
delta is the legitimate unrounded case and is not flagged.

**Precedent failure pattern:**
> A revision-era comparative meta-analysis reported a safety-outcome 2x2 with the
> arm-level events direction-reversed relative to the primary-source Table. Internal
> consistency passed because Abstract, Discussion, Table, and the R script all echoed
> the same wrong values. The reversal was caught only by an explicit second-pass audit
> that randomly sampled claims and traced each back to the primary paper.

**When to run:** MA revisions, submissions, or any review where the user mentions "check
against the source," "verify extraction," or "random sample."

**Inputs the reviewer should expect:**
- `manuscript.md` (or .docx converted to .md)
- `extraction_final.csv` (or equivalent data-extraction spreadsheet)
- A directory of primary-source PDFs (or equivalent accessible text)

**Procedure:**

1. **Inventory numerical claims** in Abstract, Results, and Discussion (patterns: `\\d+/\\d+`,
   `\\d+\\.\\d+%`, `(95% CI:`, `p\\s*=\\s*0\\.`, `I\\^2`, `n\\s*=`, etc.).

2. **Stratified random sample** — draw 5 claims across: (a) pooled estimates, (b) subgroup
   / sensitivity results, (c) comparative-arm specific values, (d) study-level numbers
   (first-cited in narrative), (e) a claim introduced during revision if the draft is post-v1.
   Comparative-arm specific values and revision-introduced numbers are the two highest-
   yield strata — always include one of each.

3. **For each sampled claim, traverse 3 layers:**
   - **Layer 1 (Manuscript → CSV):** Find the row / column in the extraction CSV.
   - **Layer 2 (CSV → Primary source):** Locate the exact Table, Figure, or paragraph in the
     original paper. Record page number.
   - **Layer 3 (Analysis script → CSV):** If the claim came from an analysis script, read the
     script and confirm its input value matches the CSV cell.

4. **Record results in a table** and append to the report:

   | Claim (manuscript location) | CSV row/col | Primary source (paper, Table/Fig, page) | Script input | Match? |
   |---|---|---|---|---|

5. **Any mismatch is a Major Comment (M-level), not Minor.** Mismatches that reverse a
   direction or change a significance boundary are P0 blockers for submission.

**Revision-specific rule:** If the manuscript contains `[VERIFY-CSV]` tags, treat each as a
mandatory audit item regardless of the sampling size. The tag exists precisely because that
number was introduced after the initial extraction pass and has not yet been independently
checked.

**Hand-entered analysis-script inputs are a code smell.** When Layer 3 reveals a `matrix(...)`,
`c(1, 2, 3)`, or `data.frame(...)` line with numerical data and no CSV-coordinate comment,
escalate to a Major Comment even if the audited values happen to match — the next revision
will re-introduce the same risk.

**Statistic-type fidelity (not just the value).** A prose sentence must match the table/CSV not
only on the **number** but on the **statistic type**. A body sentence that reports a *median*
("median eGFR 92.8") while Table 1 reports a *mean* ("mean 91.3") for the same variable cannot
be reconciled by a reviewer comparing the two — and the mismatch usually means one of them was
not regenerated after a Table 1 rule change (see the mean/median-by-skewness rule in
`/analyze-stats` `table-types/table1_demographics.md`). Treat a prose↔table statistic-type
mismatch (mean vs median, SD vs IQR, n vs %) as a Minor Comment, or Major if it sits on a
primary characteristic the conclusion leans on. Also re-check that any descriptive figure the
prose quotes (e.g. "78.4% male") matches the *current* table value, not a stale earlier one.

**Stale derived CSVs after a model/adjustment-set change (n mismatch).** When the primary model
or adjustment set changes mid-revision, **every** derived CSV (Table 2, sensitivity tables,
supplements) must be regenerated, or a stale file silently contradicts the new primary. The
fastest tell is the analytic **n**: if a derived CSV's `n` differs from the manuscript's current
primary n, suspect it is stale — and the conflict can flip a result's significance (a proteinuria
sensitivity CSV left at the old `n = 4,914` / OR 4.52 contradicted the new primary `n = 4,214` /
OR 3.99, significant ↔ not). Grep each derived CSV's `n` against the primary n; any divergence
that is not explained by a stated sub-analysis restriction is a Major Comment, `requires_reanalysis`
(re-run, not a prose edit — see Phase 4).

### Phase 2.5a-2: Design & Power Statistic Provenance (computed, not extracted)

Phase 2.5a traces data-derived numbers back to a CSV and a primary source. **Design and power
statistics are a different class and a common blind spot**: the minimum detectable effect
(MDE), a-priori or post-hoc power, the required sample size for a future trial, and the
a-priori effect-size assumptions behind them are *computed*, not extracted, so they have no
CSV row or source-paper Table to trace to. They routinely escape both the internal-consistency
check and the source-fidelity audit above.

**Precedent failure pattern:**
> A pilot study reported a minimum detectable effect of d = 1.67. No standard two-sample method
> reproduces it (the correct value at the stated n, alpha, and power was about 1.24). It survived
> several review rounds because no committed script computed it — the value had been hand-entered —
> and one reviewer even cited the figure approvingly. In the same manuscript, a set of future-trial
> sample sizes was numerically correct but had been produced with an exact noncentral-t tool, while
> the committed script used a normal approximation and printed different numbers: right value, no
> reproducible provenance.

**Procedure:**

1. **Inventory design/power claims.** Search for: "minimum detectable", "detectable effect",
   "MDE", "power" (80% / 90% / "1 − beta"), "sample size", "n = N per arm/group", "to detect",
   "powered to", "a priori", and any a-priori planning effect size (Cohen's d / f / OR used for
   sizing).

2. **Require a reproducible source for each.** Every such value must be produced by committed
   code (e.g. `statsmodels` `TTestIndPower`, a G*Power-equivalent, or an explicit noncentral-t
   computation), with the inputs stated in the manuscript: n per arm, alpha, power, allocation
   ratio, and one- vs two-sided. A value with no committed-code source is the highest-risk case.

3. **Recompute independently** with a standard tool, then classify:
   - **Not reproducible by any standard method** → likely a calculation error (Major; P0 if it
     is a headline claim). This is the d = 1.67-vs-1.24 case above.
   - **Reproducible only by a method the committed script does not implement** (e.g. the
     manuscript value is noncentral-t but the script is a normal approximation) → provenance /
     method drift. The number may be correct, but update the committed code so it reproduces the
     reported value (Major: reproducibility, not correctness).

4. **Method-consistency across the manuscript.** All power, sample-size, and MDE statistics in
   one paper should share a single method family (e.g. all noncentral-t). A mix of normal
   approximation and exact-t within one manuscript signals that some values were computed in an
   ad-hoc side tool.

5. **Any non-reproducible design/power value is a Major Comment;** a non-reproducible headline
   power or MDE claim is a P0 submission blocker.

**Hand-entered design/power statistics are a code smell even when correct.** If no committed
function emits the value, flag it: the next revision will re-introduce the risk, and a reviewer
who recomputes will not match the manuscript.

**`POWER_MODEL_MISSPEC` — the power/MDE simulation's adjustment set must match the primary model.**
For cohort "negative findings," the whole conclusion leans on the MDE ("the literature effect of
1.2–1.5 cannot be excluded"), so the MDE must be computed under the **same covariate set as the
primary analysis**. When a committed power/MDE script exists, read its model formula: if it fits
`y ~ exposure + age` (2 covariates) while the primary model adjusts for 6, it **overstates power**
(omitted covariates inflate the apparent precision) — the MDE is too small and the negative claim
too strong. Re-running a parametric bootstrap under the full model is the fix (in one worked case
MDE moved from a 2-covariate "OR 1.67" to a full-model "OR ≈ 1.70"). A power/MDE whose script omits
primary-model covariates → Major (P0 when the MDE is a headline). This is `requires_reanalysis`
(re-simulate, not a prose edit). **`POWER_VALUE_INTERPOLATED`** — any `interpolat`/`approx`/`interp`
token in a power/MDE CSV's provenance column means the headline value was never simulated on the
grid; treat a non-reproducible headline power/MDE as Major.

### Phase 2.5b: Screening-Count Reconciliation from ID Sets (SR/MA + observational tier/stratum)

Internal consistency across Abstract/Methods/Results (Phase 2.5) + source fidelity of 2×2 and
effect-size numbers (Phase 2.5a) do **not** cover study-count arithmetic. The latter is a
separate failure mode: a prior-draft prose total ("30 → 32 after FLAG consensus") can survive
every downstream pass because Abstract, Methods, Results, Discussion, Figure 1 caption, and
even the supplementary consensus file all cite the same wrong number back to each other.

**Precedent failure pattern (a PRISMA-DTA meta-analysis revision):**
> A late-revision manuscript reported study counts of k_qualitative = 32, k_narrative-only = 10,
> k_FT-excluded = 46. An ID-level recount against the screening TSV and consensus sheet (with
> FLAG additions reconciled) yielded k_qualitative = 24 with only 2 narrative-only studies
> (k_FT-excluded = 54). The original 32/10/46 figures came from an early-draft assumption that
> was never reconciled against the ID-level artifacts; downstream files (consensus markdown,
> supplementary tables, edit plans) propagated the same wrong total. Caught only by an explicit
> ID-set recount against the screening TSV and consensus spreadsheet, verified independently
> by an adversarial audit.

**When to run:** any SR/MA manuscript revision, regardless of stage. Run before Phase 3.

**Inputs:**
- Screening TSV with one row per full-text-reviewed record and an include/exclude column
- Consensus spreadsheet (Excel/CSV) with one row per record requiring adjudication and a
  `Consensus` column (typical values: `Exclude`, `Include-qualitative`, `Include-bivariate`)
- Any FLAG-adjudicated inclusion log documenting records added to the qualitative pool
  outside the primary screening TSV
- The manuscript's Table 1 (or equivalent): the definitive list of studies contributing to
  the primary quantitative synthesis

**Procedure:**

1. **Enumerate the ID sets:**
   - A = set of IDs marked INCLUDE in the screening TSV
   - B = set of IDs marked Exclude in the consensus spreadsheet
   - C = set of IDs marked Include-qualitative in the consensus spreadsheet
   - T = set of IDs represented in Table 1 (via author/year cross-match)

2. **Derive canonical totals:**
   - k_qualitative = |A \ B| + |C|
   - k_bivariate = |T|
   - k_narrative-only = k_qualitative − k_bivariate = |(A ∪ C) \ B \ T|
   - k_FT-excluded = |screening TSV rows| − |A| + |B ∩ A| + |(B \ A) encountered at FT stage|

3. **List the narrative-only IDs explicitly** — this is the highest-yield cross-check. A
   manuscript claiming "10 narrative-only studies" while the (A ∪ C) \ B \ T set contains
   only 2 IDs is an immediate P0 finding.

4. **Compare each derived total against the manuscript's prose claim** in Abstract, Methods
   §Study Selection, Results §Study Selection, Figure 1 caption, Discussion §Limitations,
   and any References §Narrative-Only heading. Any mismatch between derived total and
   manuscript prose = P0 Major Comment, blocking submission.

5. **Record results in a short reconciliation block** and append to the report:

   ```
   | Quantity | Manuscript claim | ID-derived value | Status |
   |---|---|---|---|
   | k_full-text | 78 | 78 | ✓ |
   | k_qualitative | 32 | 24 | ✗ P0 |
   | k_bivariate | 22 | 22 | ✓ |
   | k_narrative-only | 10 | 2 (IDs 120, 474) | ✗ P0 |
   | k_FT-excluded | 46 | 54 | ✗ P0 |
   ```

**Any "N → M" transition claim in a consensus summary (e.g., "30 → 32 after FLAG
consensus") that is not backed by an enumerable ID addition/subtraction set is itself a
Major Comment**, because the transition is unverifiable by downstream audit. Require
conversion of every such claim to explicit ID lists before closing the report.

**Observational tier/stratum branch.** The same set-recount logic applies when a cohort
manuscript presents an ordinal tier or mutually-exclusive stratum split. A partition that
is claimed to be disjoint must satisfy `Σ(stratum N) == unique total` and
`Σ(stratum events) == total events`; denominators that sum *above* the unique cohort
double-count subjects, and a table where every stratum n equals the grand total is a
stratum-total mis-entry rather than a partition. Run `check_cohort_arithmetic.py`
(Phase 2.5 above) with the stratum CSV — its `PARTITION_OVERLAP` verdict is the cohort
analogue of an ID-set mismatch and is a P0 Major:

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/check_cohort_arithmetic.py" \
  --manuscript manuscript.md --data analysis/strata.csv --strict
```

Also confirm the reference (baseline) row of any stratified hazard/odds table is present
and labelled; a missing reference category makes the other strata uninterpretable.

**Cross-script cut-point consistency (root cause of stratum-N drift).** When the same cohort
is re-stratified in more than one analysis script — a primary table in one file, a sensitivity
or secondary analysis in another — the derived categorical (age band, BMI category, eGFR stage,
risk tier) must use one identical cut definition: same breaks, same interval closure
(`right=`), same labels. If two scripts bin the same variable differently, per-stratum Ns drift
between tables while the grand total still reconciles, and a stratum can spuriously cross a
threshold — a `PARTITION_OVERLAP`/stratum-N check on the manuscript alone will not localize the
cause. `check_binning_consistency.py` parses the analysis source (R/Python) and emits
`BINNING_DRIFT` (Major) when one variable is derived with ≥2 different `(breaks, right)`
signatures across files:

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/check_binning_consistency.py" \
  --root analysis --root scripts --strict
```

Precedent: a screening cohort binned age with `breaks=c(-Inf,45,50,60,Inf), right=FALSE` in the
primary script and `breaks=c(-Inf,44,49,59,Inf), right=TRUE` in a threshold sensitivity script;
fractional ages fell into different bands, shifting hundreds of participants and producing a
spurious "reached" stratum in the sensitivity table that vanished once the binning was
harmonized. Fix at the source by defining each cut once in a shared helper that every script
sources.

The same gate also covers the **composite-indicator** sibling failure: a derived 0/1 component
(e.g. a metabolic-syndrome criterion built from `as.integer(a >= x | b == 1 | c == 1)`) that is
re-built in a second script with a clause dropped or added. It splits each definition into
comparison atoms on the top-level `|`, compares them as a SET (clause order, whitespace, outer
parentheses, dataframe `df$` qualifiers and commutative `&`-operands are normalized away), and
emits `DERIVED_DEF_DRIFT` (Major) when one variable carries ≥2 distinct atom sets across scripts.
Precedent: `mets_bp <- as.integer(bl_he_sbp>=130 | bl_he_dbp>=85 | bl_tx_hypertension_med==1 |
bl_hypertension==1)` in the benchmark script vs the same name without the final
`| bl_hypertension==1` in a re-analysis script — the metabolic-syndrome C-index then read 0.6704
in one table and 0.6712 in another.

### Phase 2.5c: Reference Hallucination Scan

Numerical audits (2.5/2.5a/2.5b) cover in-text numbers; they do **not** cover reference-list integrity. LLM-drafted or co-author-handed-in bibliographies frequently contain fabricated DOIs, wrong author/year combinations for a real DOI, or plausible-looking references that never existed. These slip past human proofreading because the surface form looks canonical.

**When to run:** every manuscript at self-review, regardless of stage. Mandatory before submission and before any revision circulation to co-authors or the editor.

**Procedure:**

1. **Locate the bibliography.** From `SSOT.yaml` → `truth.refs_bib` (fallback `manuscript/_src/refs.bib` for legacy projects). If `SSOT.yaml` is absent, scan `references/library.bib` as a last resort.

2. **Invoke `/verify-refs`** on the resolved bib. The skill writes `qc/reference_audit.json` with a per-entry verdict (`VERIFIED` / `FABRICATED` / `UNVERIFIED`) and a top-level `submission_safe` boolean.

   ```bash
   # equivalent CLI form (same result as invoking the skill).
   # verify_refs.py takes a positional input (the .bib path) and writes its audit
   # to <project-root>/qc/reference_audit.json (path derived from --project-root).
   BIB="$(python3 -c "import yaml; print(yaml.safe_load(open('SSOT.yaml'))['truth']['refs_bib'])")"
   python3 skills/verify-refs/scripts/verify_refs.py "$BIB" --project-root . --strict
   ```

   When both reference QC and cross-reference QC are needed in one pass, prefer
   the master orchestration entry point in `/manage-refs` — it chains
   `check_citation_keys.py` → `verify_refs.py --strict` → `render_pandoc.sh`
   (optional) → `check_xref.py --strict` and writes
   `qc/pre_submission_gate.json` as the single submission-readiness artifact:

   ```bash
   bash "${MEDSCI_SKILLS_ROOT:-$HOME/workspace/medsci-skills}/skills/manage-refs/scripts/pre_submission_gate.sh" \
       --md manuscript/manuscript.md \
       --bib manuscript/_src/refs.bib \
       --docx submission/<journal>/manuscript.docx \
       --allow-separate-attachments  # see Phase 2.5d for when this is appropriate
   ```

3. **Read `qc/reference_audit.json`.** For each entry not marked `VERIFIED`, add a row to the reconciliation block below. `FABRICATED` entries are P0 Major Comments (block submission). `UNVERIFIED` entries are Minor Comments unless the manuscript is at a circulation/submission gate, in which case they escalate to Major. For each `duplicate_findings[]` entry (category `duplicate_pmid` / `duplicate_doi`), add a Major Comment row noting the duplicated `ref_ids` pair and recommend cite renumbering — duplicates block submission (P0 Major) regardless of per-record `VERIFIED` status.

4. **Cross-check placeholder + pagination drift.** Run, on every round:

   ```bash
   grep -nE '\[@NEW:|\[N\]|\[N–N\]|e0{3}.{0,5}e0{3}|in[ .]?press|\bTBD\b|forthcoming' manuscript/
   ```

   Two failure classes:
   - **Citation-queue placeholders** (`[@NEW:topic]`, `[N]`, `[N–N]`): a citation slot that was never resolved. Any remaining at self-review is a P0.
   - **Pagination placeholders** (`e000–e000`, `in press`, `TBD`, `forthcoming`): `/verify-refs` (Phase 2.5c step 2) marks these `UNVERIFIED` with `note = "pagination_placeholder"` but cannot judge centrality from the .bib alone. **Here, with the manuscript in hand, decide centrality:** if the unresolved reference supports a method choice or a headline claim (grep the citekey/marker against the Abstract, the Statistical Analysis subsection, and the first Results paragraph), escalate it to a **P0 Major** rather than a generic Minor. A method-load-bearing citation that is still "in press / e000" at submission is a blocker. Include each in the reconciliation block.

5. **Record results in a short reconciliation block** and append to the Phase 3 report:

   ```
   | Citekey | Verdict | Source check | Status |
   |---|---|---|---|
   | Kim_2024_Validation | VERIFIED | DOI + PubMed match | ✓ |
   | Park_2023_Radiomics | FABRICATED | DOI resolves to unrelated paper | ✗ P0 |
   | Lee_2022_DeepLearning | UNVERIFIED | No DOI/PMID, title not found | △ Major before submission |
   | [@NEW:segmentation_review] | PLACEHOLDER | unresolved citation queue | ✗ P0 |
   ```

**Short-circuit rule:** if `qc/reference_audit.json` already exists with a bib-hash match within 60s (P9 cache TTL, pending), the scan MAY reuse it; otherwise re-run. Never consume a stale audit from a prior manuscript revision.

**Do NOT fabricate replacement references** if any entry fails. Fix-forward belongs to `/search-lit` and `/lit-sync`, not to this skill. Self-review only reports the failure and blocks submission.

### Phase 2.5c-2: Reference Adequacy Scan

Phase 2.5c covers reference **integrity** — are the cited references real (fabricated / unverified / duplicate / placeholder)? It does **not** ask whether there are *enough* references, in the right sections, grounding every named method. That is reference **adequacy**, and it is the failure mode behind a draft with thirteen references where the Statistical Analysis subsection names a competing-risk model, multiple imputation, the E-value, and an eGFR equation with zero citations. Keep the two strictly separate: an integrity failure blocks because a citation is *wrong*; an adequacy failure flags because a citation is *missing*.

**When to run:** every manuscript at self-review, after the integrity scan. The two share the manuscript and the resolved bib path.

**Procedure:**

1. **Run the deterministic checker.** Resolve the article type from `project.yaml` (passed verbatim; the script's alias map handles repo paper-type names) and the journal cap from the target journal profile when known:

   ```bash
   python3 "${MEDSCI_SKILLS_ROOT:-$HOME/workspace/medsci-skills}/skills/self-review/scripts/check_reference_adequacy.py" \
     --manuscript manuscript/manuscript.md --bib "$BIB" \
     --article-type "$TYPE" ${CAP:+--journal-cap "$CAP"} \
     --out qc/reference_adequacy.json --strict
   ```

   It reports the cited-reference count vs the article-type target, the section distribution (Introduction / Methods / Results / Discussion), every named method found in the Methods/Statistical-Analysis block, which of them lack a citation in their paragraph, and a `methods_zero_citations` flag.

2. **Fold `findings[]` into the review.** Each finding becomes a standard `issues[]` entry (so `/revise` and downstream consumers ingest adequacy and other comments uniformly), **additively** carrying the machine-readable `issue_type` + `subtype` alongside the usual fields, under `category: "F" / category_name: "Reporting Completeness"`:

   ```json
   {"id":"M2","severity":"major","category":"F","category_name":"Reporting Completeness",
    "issue_type":"reference_adequacy","subtype":"methods_named_method_uncited",
    "location":"Methods - Statistical Analysis",
    "description":"Fine-Gray competing-risk model is named without a canonical citation.",
    "fixable_by_ai":false,
    "suggested_fix":"Run /search-lit for the canonical Fine-Gray competing-risk source, sync via /lit-sync, then rerun /verify-refs --strict."}
   ```

   **Severity:** `methods_zero_citations` (original / AI-validation / meta-analysis) and each uncited statistical method → **Major** (a P0 candidate before submission when the method is central to the primary or a sensitivity analysis); each uncited reporting/diagnostic standard → **Minor**; a total count below the article-type target → **Major** when far below (under half the floor), otherwise **Minor**, scaled also by stage (escalate at a submission/circulation gate).

3. **Fix-forward, not fabricate.** As in Phase 2.5c, this skill never writes replacement references. Every adequacy finding carries `fixable_by_ai: false`; the remedy is `/search-lit` (Manuscript Paper Reference Pool mode) → `/lit-sync` → `/verify-refs --strict`, which the author runs.

### Phase 2.5d: Cross-Reference QC (Manuscript ↔ rendered DOCX)

Before the DOCX is built, run the **markdown-stage orphan gate** — every captioned
`Figure N.` / `Table N.` must be cited at least once elsewhere in the body:

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/check_figure_citation.py" \
  --manuscript manuscript.md --out qc/figure_citation.json
```

`FIGURE_ORPHAN` / `TABLE_ORPHAN` (Minor) catch a newly-added float that has a legend
but no in-text citation — the early, no-build counterpart to `check_xref`'s `UNCITED`
verdict, which catches the same class on the rendered DOCX (below).

Reference-list integrity (Phase 2.5c) does **not** cover Table/Figure
cross-references. This is a separate failure mode where in-text citations
("Supplementary Table S4 reports a sensitivity analysis") resolve to a different
caption in the rendered DOCX ("Supp Table S4 = a diagnostics table") because the
build script carries its own legacy SSOT. Internal consistency (Phase 2.5)
cannot detect it — both the prose and the build artifact echo their own
divergent truths cleanly.

**Precedent failure pattern (an STROBE cohort manuscript revision):**
> Body prose cited Supp Table S4 as a sensitivity analysis; the rendered DOCX
> S4 instead contained a diagnostics table. S1, S6, S7 also mismatched. S8 and S9
> were cited in the manuscript but absent from the rendered DOCX entirely.
> Caught only on co-author circulation review.

**When to run:** every manuscript at self-review when a rendered DOCX exists
(e.g., circulation drafts, post-build pre-submission checks). Skip only if no
DOCX build has occurred yet (early drafts).

**Procedure:**

1. **Locate inputs.** `manuscript/manuscript.md` (or the SSOT `truth.manuscript_md`)
   and the rendered DOCX (typically `manuscript/manuscript_final.docx` or the
   most recent circulation `.docx`).

2. **Invoke the shared script** (lives in `/manage-refs`):

   ```bash
   python3 "${MEDSCI_SKILLS_ROOT:-$HOME/workspace/medsci-skills}/skills/manage-refs/scripts/check_xref.py" \
     --md manuscript/manuscript.md \
     --docx manuscript/manuscript_final.docx \
     --out qc/xref_audit.json \
     [--allow-separate-attachments]
   ```

   The script writes `qc/xref_audit.json` with per-label rows tagged
   `OK | MISSING_DOCX | MISSING_BODY | MISMATCH | UNCITED | NOT_CITED_NO_BODY`,
   a top-level `submission_safe` boolean, and a `policy.allow_separate_attachments`
   field that records which severity policy applied.

3. **Translate findings to anticipated comments.** Severity mapping depends on
   the journal's figure/table submission policy. Many radiology and medical
   journals (e.g., European Radiology, Radiology, AJR) accept figures and tables
   as separate attachment files rather than inline in the manuscript DOCX; for
   those workflows pass `--allow-separate-attachments` so MISSING_DOCX is not
   treated as a P0 blocker. `MISSING_BODY` and `MISMATCH` remain P0 regardless,
   because they indicate SSOT drift between body markdown and rendered DOCX
   rather than a legitimate attachment style.

   | Status | Default policy | With `--allow-separate-attachments` |
   |---|---|---|
   | `MISSING_DOCX` | **Major (P0)** — cited Table/Figure absent from rendered output | **Minor** — figure/table is separately attached per journal policy |
   | `MISSING_BODY` | **Major (P0)** — build SSOT drift; rendered caption has no body definition | **Major (P0)** (no change) |
   | `MISMATCH` | **Major (P0)** — caption text disagrees between body and rendered DOCX | **Major (P0)** (no change) |
   | `UNCITED` | Minor — orphan caption that should be cited or removed | Minor (no change) |

4. **Append a reconciliation block to the Phase 3 report:**

   ```
   | Label | Status | Body caption | DOCX caption | Verdict |
   |---|---|---|---|---|
   | Supplementary Table S4 | MISMATCH | Sensitivity analysis | Diagnostics table | ✗ P0 |
   | Supplementary Table S8 | MISSING_DOCX | (defined in body) | — | ✗ P0 |
   | Figure 2 | UNCITED | Forest plot of subgroups | Forest plot of subgroups | △ Minor |
   ```

5. **Emit each P0 row as a separate `M`-numbered Major Comment** with
   `category: "F"` (Reporting Completeness) and `fixable_by_ai: false`
   (build script changes are out of scope for the auto-fix loop — they
   require pipeline-side fixes per `/write-paper` Step 7.6a routing).

**Do NOT auto-fix cross-reference defects in `--fix` mode.** Caption rewrites
in the body without re-running the DOCX build will simply move the mismatch.
Surface as Major Comments and let the user route to `/write-paper` Step 7.6a.

### Phase 2.5e: Confounding Completeness (observational only)

**When to run:** the manuscript is observational (cohort, case-control, cross-sectional,
health-screening registry) and the central claim is an adjusted exposure–outcome
association. **Skip for RCTs, diagnostic-accuracy, SR/MA, and descriptive studies** — which
is why the full procedure is loaded on demand rather than carried inline.

The highest-yield, most mechanical observational finding — a covariate that is **measured**,
**imbalanced across exposure groups** in Table 1, and **absent from the adjustment set**
(residual confounding by a measured variable) — is invisible to a prose pass and only
exposed by joining the exposure-stratified Table 1 against the Methods adjustment set
(probe O1). Run the deterministic gate and treat each `UNADJUSTED_IMBALANCED` covariate as
an Anticipated Major Comment (category A. Study Design & Data Integrity):

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/check_confounding_completeness.py" \
  --table1 table1_by_<exposure>.csv \
  --adjusted-list "age, sex, BMI, hypertension, diabetes" \
  --exposure-defining-list "body mass index, waist, fasting glucose, triglycerides, HDL cholesterol" \
  --out qc/confounding_completeness.json --strict
```

When the manuscript is observational, **load `references/phases/confounding_completeness.md`**
for the full procedure: the precedent failure pattern; the `--exposure-defining-list`
over-adjustment exemption for guideline-defined exposures (MASLD / metabolic syndrome / CKM
/ sarcopenia / frailty); the SMD-from-`mean ± SD` fallback; the extended-adjustment
sensitivity model and its frame discipline (refit the unadjusted estimate on the reduced
complete-case frame, not the full frame); and the rest of the observational probe set
(O2–O10) from `references/domain-probes/observational_confounding.md`.

### Phase 2.5f: Claim-vs-Artifact Cross-Check

Phases 2.5–2.5e check numbers and adjustment sets. This phase checks **claims
against the external artifacts they should trace to** — the pre-registration, the
protocol, the analysis outputs. These are the errors that survive a single-pass
review because the manuscript prose is internally consistent yet disagrees with
the registration or the analysis it reports. The first scope is the two highest-
value, deterministic instances; figure/flow-count reconciliation, Methods-promised-
analysis completeness, and imputation-input integrity are separate subchecks (run
`/make-figures` legend reconciliation and `/write-paper`'s Methods-promised gate).

**Precedent failure pattern:**
> A manuscript reported a null primary association from a multiple-imputation model
> and described it as "pre-specified," while the registered primary had been the
> complete-case model that was significant — the primary had been re-designated after
> the results were known. In the same paper an E-value of 2.79 was attached to the
> primary HR of 1.34, but 2.79 does not recompute from 1.34 (it came from a different,
> non-primary estimate), and a second E-value bounded an exploratory cancer-specific
> hazard, not the headline contrast. None of these tripped the internal-consistency
> checks; all three are deterministic against the registration and the arithmetic.

**Procedure:**

1. **Run the cross-check** with the manuscript and (if available) the pre-registration
   / protocol / `project.yaml`:

   ```bash
   python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/check_claim_artifact.py" \
     --manuscript manuscript.md --prereg prereg.md \
     --out qc/claim_artifact.json --strict
   ```

2. **Estimand provenance.** The script raises `PRIMARY_REASSIGNED` (Major,
   category: A. Study Design & Data Integrity) only on **explicit** language that the
   primary was re-designated / switched / chosen post-hoc after results were known — a
   genuine P0. The fix is to report the pre-specified and the revised models
   **coequally** and disclose the change in the Abstract and Limitations, not to
   silently lead with the more favourable estimate. Two related verdicts are
   **advisory, not Major** — surface them as Anticipated Minor Comments to confirm,
   never as a blocker: `ESTIMAND_DRIFT` (the fuzzy manuscript↔registration primary
   token overlap is below threshold — noisy; confirm against the actual registration
   before treating it as drift) and `PRIMARY_DISCLOSURE_NOTE` (the manuscript discloses
   a manuscript-stage analytical decision — the honest disclosure estimand-provenance
   guidance *recommends writing*; confirm it is reported coequally, do not penalise it).

3. **E-value.** `EVALUE_ARITHMETIC` means the reported E-value does not recompute from
   its adjacent effect estimate (the value was likely produced for a different estimate);
   `EVALUE_NON_PRIMARY` means the E-value is attached to a secondary/exploratory estimate
   but presented as if it bounded the headline claim. Both warrant a Major/Minor comment —
   recompute the E-value for the **declared primary** estimate and its near-null confidence
   limit, and quote it there.

4. **Primary-change guard.** Independently of the script, if the manuscript reports two
   models for the same contrast where one is significant and the other null and the
   significant one is foregrounded, confirm which was pre-specified; an outcome-dependent
   choice of primary model is a Major comment even when each model is individually correct.

5. **Headline vs own-sensitivity direction.** Read the sensitivity series (S1 etc.) the
   manuscript itself reports. If the headline causal/association claim points the *opposite*
   way from the authors' own adjusted or sensitivity estimate — a positive lead sentence over
   a sensitivity model that attenuates to the null, or vice versa — that is a Major: the paper
   is contradicting its own robustness check. This is a prose judgement, not a script verdict.

6. **Methods ↔ Results ↔ disk coverage.** Run the deterministic coverage gate:

   ```bash
   python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/check_artifact_coverage.py" \
     --manuscript manuscript.md --analysis-dir output/analysis \
     --out qc/artifact_coverage.json --strict
   ```

   `PROMISED_ABSENT` (an analysis named in Methods that never reaches Results) and
   `DISK_UNREPORTED` (an analysis output on disk — an added-value DeLong CSV, a calibration
   table — never mentioned in the manuscript) are Anticipated Major Comments. The reverse
   direction matters because a run-but-unreported result can be the one that undercuts the
   headline. When an `_analysis_outputs.md` manifest exists the gate uses it as the source of
   truth; otherwise it globs `--analysis-dir` and only escalates analysis-bearing file names.

   The same gate also flags `PROMISED_STAT_NO_VALUE`: a statistic framed as a **bound/
   ceiling/de-confounded** value (e.g. "the de-confounded reader AUC is reported in
   Table S16", "the classifier ceiling AUC") promised with a reporting verb but never
   given a numeric value anywhere in the manuscript **or supplement** — the bound that
   makes the primary estimand interpretable, sometimes marked "Addressed" in a checklist
   yet absent from every table. Pass the rendered supplement so the corpus is complete:

   ```bash
   python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/check_artifact_coverage.py" \
     --manuscript manuscript.md --supplement supplement.md \
     --out qc/artifact_coverage.json --strict
   ```

7. **Supplement / tables / caption hygiene.** Phases 2.5–2.5e and the classical-style
   gate lint `manuscript.md` only; the rendered **supplement, a separately-built tables
   file, and figure-caption files** are never linted — yet that is where technical-check-
   fatal residue hides (internal §/§L SAP labels, unfilled `Table SX`/`[Authors]`
   placeholders, `[VERIFY]`/`TODO` build markers, response-to-reviewers framing, planning
   residue, and body↔supplement cross-reference numbers that do not resolve). Run the
   supplement-hygiene gate over **every** rendered reader-facing artifact:

   ```bash
   python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/check_supplement_hygiene.py" \
     --supplement supplement.md --supplement tables.md --supplement captions.md \
     --manuscript manuscript.md --out qc/supplement_hygiene.json --strict
   ```

   All verdicts (`SUPP_INTERNAL_LABEL`, `SUPP_PLACEHOLDER`, `SUPP_BUILD_MARKER`,
   `SUPP_RESPONSE_FRAMING`, `SUPP_PLANNING_RESIDUE`, `SUPP_XREF_UNRESOLVED`) are
   Anticipated Major Comments — a reader-facing slip in a supplement is as fatal at a
   technical check as one in the body.

   **Float citation order (same technical-check pass).** Editorial offices "unsubmit"
   manuscripts *before* peer review when numbered floats are not cited in ascending
   order of first appearance — a fully deterministic desk-check item the hygiene gate
   above does not cover (it lints xref *resolution*, not *order*). Run the citation-order
   gate, which checks each series independently (main Tables, main Figures, Supplementary
   Tables, Supplementary Figures), scanning only the narrative body (it auto-excludes the
   Figure Legends / back-matter so an in-order legends block cannot mask an out-of-order
   body):

   ```bash
   python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/check_citation_order.py" \
     --manuscript manuscript.md --out qc/citation_order.json --strict
   ```

   `CITATION_ORDER` (Major) — a series cited out of numerical order (e.g. Table 3 before
   Tables 1–2, or Supplementary Tables cited S4, S9, S16, S12, …); fix by renumbering the
   series by first-citation order (and reordering the float/supplement document + remapping
   every cross-reference, expanding ranges like `S12–S15` by hand and leaving non-float
   sensitivity-spec labels such as `S1–S6` untouched) or by rephrasing away the early
   citation. `CITATION_GAP` (Minor) — cited numbers not contiguous from 1 (a possible
   missing/mis-numbered float).

8. **Re-run cross-artifact staleness after any audit or reframe.** When a headline number
   is corrected or an analysis is re-framed, the fix often lands only in the body while a
   supplement footnote or a figure-source data file keeps the stale (sometimes *reversed*)
   value. Re-run `/sync-submission`'s `check_cross_artifact_stale.py` across the body, the
   supplement, and any figure-source data immediately **after** the reframe — not just once
   at the start — so a corrected body never ships next to a stale supplement.

9. **Power-aware null interpretation.** A headline negative claim ("no synergy", "not
   associated", "showed no difference") is interpretable only next to a precision
   statement — a minimum-detectable-effect, a power calculation, an equivalence
   margin/TOST, or a CI-compatibility sentence. Run the null-calibration gate:

   ```bash
   python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/check_null_calibration.py" \
     --manuscript manuscript.md --out qc/null_calibration.json --strict
   ```

   `CONFIRM_NULL_NO_MDE` (Major) fires when a negative/equivalence claim in the Title/
   Abstract/Conclusion has no such token anywhere in those regions — a non-significant
   result is not evidence of no effect without one. (A single MDE/power/equivalence/CI-
   compatibility sentence suppresses it.) Pair with the interaction-scale checks (`O14`)
   when the null is a synergy/interaction claim.

10. **Confidence-weighted / rating → AUC monotonicity.** For an observer or reader study
    that collapses a (binary-call × confidence) rating into a single score used as the
    ROC/AUC predictor, verify the encoding is **strictly monotonic** across the full
    ladder — a *folded* score (`cws = confidence if positive-call else 6 − confidence`)
    collapses opposite (call × confidence) cells and silently mis-estimates the AUC; a
    prose review cannot see an estimator bug. Run the encoding through the reusable
    monotonicity probe and ship its 10-combination unit test:
    `python3 "${MEDSCI_SKILLS_ROOT}/skills/analyze-stats/scripts/rating_monotonicity.py" --encoding score_def.json`.

11. **Figure-embedded numbers are text-grep blind.** PRISMA/flow/forest/statistic figures
    are rasterised, so every numeric audit above is blind to the numbers *inside* them.
    Before submission, (a) **visually** read each such figure page in the rendered/blind
    PDF, and (b) reconcile the **hard-coded integers** in the figure-generation script
    (`create_figure*.R`, `make_*.py`) against the body/flow-source counts
    (`grep -nE '<-\s*[0-9]+|=\s*[0-9]+' figures/*.R`). See `submission-portal-verification`
    §9.5 (figure-image DATA drift) for the full procedure.

The script is deterministic but its provenance match is fuzzy (token overlap): read the
reconciliation in `qc/claim_artifact.json` and confirm against the actual registration
before raising `ESTIMAND_DRIFT`. For time-to-event manuscripts, also apply probe **S8
(estimand provenance)** of `references/domain-probes/survival_prognostic.md`.

### Phase 2.5g: Editorial-Impression / Defensiveness Scan (the ceiling pass)

Run this **after** the floor gates (Phases 2.5–2.5f), because it reads the *accurate* manuscript
and recommends what to take back out. It is the operational form of category L and the
counterweight to the additive bias of the rest of the stack: every other phase can only make the
manuscript longer and more defended; this one is the only phase that can make it shorter and more
confident. It is advisory and **non-blocking** — it never produces a Major and never gates
submission.

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/check_editorial_impression.py" \
  --manuscript manuscript.md --out qc/editorial_impression.json
```

The gate reads the manuscript as a whole, segments it by IMRAD heading, and emits up to six
verdicts, each tagged with a SUBTRACTION `action`:

| Verdict | Reads as | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `HEDGE_DENSITY` | defensive-caveat tokens per 1,000 narrative words over threshold | TIGHTEN |
| `HEDGE_REPEAT` | one caveat motif repeated across body + Abstract | TIGHTEN |
| `AUDIT_IN_BODY` | SHA / commit / unit-test / post-lock / manifest / seed in the narrative | MOVE (→ Methods/supplement) |
| `LIMITATIONS_VOLUME` | a long enumerated Limitations list | TIGHTEN (consolidate) |
| `ABSTRACT_CAVEAT_LOAD` | several caveat clauses in the Abstract | TIGHTEN |
| `BURIED_DEFENSE` | strong numeric robustness result only in Limitations/supplement | MOVE (→ Results) |

**Fold the findings into the report as the SUBTRACTION axis, not the additive one.** Each
becomes a Minor `issues[]` entry under `category: "L" / category_name: "Editorial impression"`,
additively carrying `issue_type: "editorial_impression"`, `subtype: <verdict>`, and
`action: "REMOVE" | "MOVE" | "TIGHTEN"`. They are summarized in their own Phase 3 block
("Editorial-Impression Risks — REMOVE / MOVE / TIGHTEN"), kept visually separate from the
"Anticipated Major / Minor Comments (ADD / FIX)" so the author sees both forces. Mark them
`fixable_by_ai: false` by default — TIGHTEN-ing a hedge or MOVE-ing a robustness result is a
voice-and-judgment edit the author should own — except a clearly-redundant repeated caveat
(`HEDGE_REPEAT`), which `--fix` may collapse to a single statement.

**Net-impact note.** When an *earlier* phase recommends adding a caveat or disclosure, weigh it
against L: an integrity-critical disclosure is a **must (state it once, crisply)**, but a
defensive over-disclosure is a **cut / move**. The two are not symmetric — keep the disclosure,
but place it once and point to the supplement rather than repeating it at every claim site
(placement discipline: main text narrates, auditability lives in the supplement).

### Phase 2.6: Multi-Agent Panel Review (--panel, opt-in)

Run this phase **only when `--panel` is passed**. The default single-pass review (Phases 2–2.5d) stays the fast path; the panel is the high-cost, high-precision option for a pre-submission final pass on a top-tier target. Run it after the numerical audits (Phases 2.5–2.5d) so the reviewers see source-verified numbers, and before the Phase 3 report, which it feeds.

**Precondition (blocking): the SSOT must be singular.** Before spawning any reviewer, enforce the Phase 1 step 4 SSOT gate: if more than one manuscript-like `.md` exists and none is pinned (no `SSOT.yaml` `truth.manuscript_md`, no explicit `--ssot`), **halt and ask the user which file is the SSOT** — a panel is too expensive to spend on a stale copy. Clear any `STALE_COPY` from `detect_copy_divergence.py` first.

The panel simulates independent peer reviewers who do not see each other's comments, then an editor who consolidates them — the same structure a journal uses. It reuses the vendored domain-probe modules so every reviewer applies the same criteria.

**Step 1 — Compose the reviewer set by research type.** Auto-detect the manuscript type (Phase 1 input + the Research-Type Adaptation table). Each reviewer loads the matching domain-probe module so the panel's criteria are single-sourced.

| Research type | Reviewer set (each is one reviewer) | Domain-probe module each loads |
|---|---|---|
| Survival / prognostic cohort | R1 Biostatistics & Study Design · R2 Clinical (domain) · R3 Imaging/Radiology (if an imaging exposure) | `references/domain-probes/survival_prognostic.md` |
| Systematic review / meta-analysis | R1 Methodology (search/screening/PRISMA) · R2 Clinical · R3 Statistics (pooling/heterogeneity) | `references/domain-probes/sr_ma.md` |
| Radiomics / feature reproducibility | R1 Imaging physics & acquisition · R2 ML / Statistics · R3 Clinical translation | `references/domain-probes/radiomics.md` |
| Diagnostic-accuracy / AI model | R1 Study design & leakage · R2 Statistics (DeLong, calibration) · R3 Clinical / reference standard | `references/domain-probes/sr_ma.md` (P1 DTA cells) + `references/domain-probes/ai_overclaiming.md` (AO0–AO7, for AI clinical claims) + categories A–C |
| Observational (STROBE) | R1 Epidemiology / confounding · R2 Clinical · R3 Statistics | `references/domain-probes/observational_confounding.md` (O1/O8 run as the Phase 2.5e / `check_cohort_arithmetic.py --id-col` deterministic gates; O7 over-adjustment) + `references/domain-probes/clinical_prediction_model.md` (CP1–CP4, when it is a prediction-model paper) + categories A–J + the effect-size / added-value axes |
| Narrative / review article | R1 Domain-content expert · R2 Methodology / SANRA · R3 Technical accuracy · R4 Adversarial reject-hunter (structural: RV9 curated-base circularity, RV6 single-anchor overload, RV8 self-citation architecture) | `references/domain-probes/narrative_review.md` |
| Case report | R1 Clinical case-report reviewer · R2 Ethics / de-identification · R3 Literature-context reviewer | `references/domain-probes/case_report.md` + CARE items + categories D/F/G |

If the type is ambiguous, ask the user before composing the set.

Append the **handling-editor desk-impression** persona (the ceiling lens) to every reviewer set:
it loads no domain probe, reads only for narrative confidence vs over-defensiveness, and returns
Minor REMOVE / MOVE / TIGHTEN findings (category L) that the editor routes to the separate
Editorial-Impression Risks block. Its focus checklist is in `references/panel_review_template.md`.
It does not count toward the Step 3.5 lens-diversity axes.

**Step 2 — Run the reviewers (portable execution).** When the host provides a parallel subagent / Task capability (Claude Code, or any harness exposing an Agent tool), spawn the reviewer set as independent parallel subagents, each blinded to the others, then run the editor as a final synthesis agent. **Fallback (no subagent capability — e.g. a minimal Codex/Cursor harness):** a single agent role-plays each reviewer sequentially and in isolation — it completes and writes out reviewer R1's full structured review before reading the manuscript "fresh" as R2, so a later reviewer never sees an earlier reviewer's comments. The panel is defined by these instructions; it does **not** depend on the `Workflow` tool or any Claude-Code-only orchestration.

A reusable reviewer schema, a generic harsh-but-fair reviewer prompt skeleton with per-domain focus checklists, and the editor synthesis prompt skeleton live in `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/panel_review_template.md`.

Each reviewer returns: `reviewer_id`, `expertise_area`, an `overall_assessment` (name the single biggest threat to the conclusions), `strengths` (2–3), `major[]` (each with `heading`, `comment`, `location`, `severity`, `suggested_fix`), and `minor[]`. Map `severity` onto this skill's own scale — a conclusion-threatening / design-level finding is **Fatal**, a reporting-level finding is **Fixable** — rather than introducing a separate vocabulary.

**Step 3 — Editor synthesis.** One editor pass (a final agent, or the main agent in the fallback) consolidates the reviews:
1. **Dedupe** findings by theme across reviewers.
2. **Flag CONSENSUS** for any theme raised by ≥2 reviewers, with R1/R2/R3 attribution (e.g., `[CONSENSUS: R1+R3]`); single-reviewer findings are attributed to the one reviewer.
3. **Decide** an internal readiness verdict (this sets the Phase 3c `verdict` / `overall_score`; it is not printed as a journal recommendation).
4. **Rank** the concrete pre-submission actions the author should complete first.
5. State a one-line **readiness verdict** (ready for the target tier now / fix specific items first / consider a different tier).

**Step 3.5 — Lens-diversity gate (deterministic).** A panel only earns its cost if its reviewers span *distinct* axes rather than echo one theme louder. Before the editor finalizes, serialize the reviewers' structured outputs (the schema above) to a JSON file — either a top-level list or `{"reviewers": [...], "research_type": "..."}` — and run the gate:

```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/check_panel_diversity.py \
    --panel panel_reviews.json \
    --research-type {survival|sr_ma|radiomics|dta|observational|narrative} --strict
```

It reports three diversity failures, each mapped onto a concern family aligned to the focus checklists:
- **`UNCOVERED_AXIS`** (Major) — an axis the research type is expected to probe (e.g. heterogeneity/pooling for an SR/MA) drew **zero** major findings. The editor re-probes it with the owning reviewer before finalizing, or records in the synthesis why the gap is acceptable.
- **`FAMILY_MONOCULTURE`** (Major) — the majority of majors fall in one concern family; the lenses converged rather than spanned the manuscript.
- **`LENS_COLLAPSE`** (Flag) — a reviewer raised only families another reviewer already covered, adding no independent axis.

Healthy CONSENSUS is preserved — agreement on *some* themes is a strength (Step 3 flags it), and the gate fires `LENS_COLLAPSE` only on a *fully* redundant reviewer and the Major checks on panel-level coverage, never on agreement per se. Do not silently ship a monoculture: resolve every Major before the synthesis verdict.

**Step 4 — Feed Phase 3.** The consolidated panel output flows into the Phase 3 report, Phase 3b R0 numbering (**preserved**, so `/revise` still consumes it), and Phase 3c JSON. CONSENSUS flags and reviewer attribution are additive annotations on the existing `M`/`m` comments (and the optional `consensus` JSON field); they do not change the report or JSON structure.

**Re-run the panel after a large revision.** A panel is high-yield not only before the first submission but **again after any large edit** — a word-count compression, a primary-model or adjustment-set change, or resolving a batch of majors. Such edits introduce *new* drift (a compression drops a caveat; a re-fit leaves a derived CSV stale; a relocation orphans a cross-reference), and the second panel's findings shift character accordingly (method → compression-drift → residual). If the author has just compressed or re-modelled, recommend one more `--panel` pass rather than assuming the prior panel still holds; in practice each post-revision round surfaces real, distinct errors.

### Phase 3: Report

Before writing the Anticipated Comments, skim `references/exemplar_findings/` for the
finding at hand (cohort-arithmetic mismatch, unadjusted confounder, cross-sectional scope
overreach, post-hoc primary / estimand drift). Each models the full shape — which gate
fired, the comment in the reviewer's own words, Fatal/Fixable severity, the closest
category letter, the concrete fix, `fixable_by_ai`, and an R0-ready line for Phase 3b.
They are synthetic teaching models — match the structure, not the wording.

Generate a concise report with this structure:

```markdown
# Self-Review Report: {manuscript title}

**Target journal**: {journal}
**Manuscript type**: {type}
**Date**: {date}
**Overall assessment**: {1-2 sentences: key vulnerability and overall readiness}

## Anticipated Major Comments (fix before submission)

M1. **{Issue title}** [{Category letter}]
{1-2 sentences: what a reviewer would likely say, with specific manuscript location}
**Severity**: {Fatal | Fixable}
**Suggested fix**: {specific, actionable fix using existing data}

M2. ...

## Anticipated Minor Comments (address proactively)

m1. **{Issue}** [{Category}]: {1 sentence with location + fix}
m2. ...

## Editorial-Impression Risks (REMOVE / MOVE / TIGHTEN)

*The subtraction axis — what to take out, move, or tighten so the accurate manuscript reads
confidently. Advisory and non-blocking; from Phase 2.5g / category L. Omit this block only if the
scan returned nothing.*

L1. **{Issue}** [{REMOVE | MOVE | TIGHTEN}]: {1 sentence — what reads as over-defensive and where, with the subtraction to make}
L2. ...

## Strengths (emphasize in cover letter)

- {Specific strength 1}
- {Specific strength 2}
- ...
```

The report carries **two** axes, kept visually separate: the **ADD / FIX** axis (Anticipated
Major / Minor Comments — what is missing or wrong) and the **SUBTRACTION** axis
(Editorial-Impression Risks — what to remove, move, or tighten). Do not fold the L items into the
Minor Comments; an author who sees only "add this" will monotonically over-defend.

**Conciseness targets**:
- Anticipated Major Comments: 3-7 items, each 3-5 lines
- Anticipated Minor Comments: 3-6 items, each 1-2 sentences
- Editorial-Impression Risks: 0-6 items, each 1 sentence (only what the Phase 2.5g gate flagged)
- Strengths: 3-5 items, each 1 sentence
- Total report: 400-800 words (excluding optional R0 section)

### Phase 3b: R0 Numbering (Optional)

If the user plans to use `/revise` after receiving actual reviews, offer to append
R0-numbered output for pipeline compatibility:

```markdown
## R0 Pre-Submission Findings (for /revise cross-reference)

R0-1 [MAJ] {mapped from M1}: {issue title}
R0-2 [MAJ] {mapped from M2}: {issue title}
R0-3 [MIN] {mapped from m1}: {issue title}
...
```

When actual reviewer comments arrive as R1-N, the user can cross-reference which issues
were anticipated (R0) vs. novel (R1-only).

### Phase 3c: Structured JSON Output

When `--json` is passed, or when invoked by `/write-paper` Phase 7, append a machine-readable JSON block after the markdown report. Fence it with triple backticks and the `json` language tag so downstream parsers can extract it.

```json
{
  "self_review_version": "1.0",
  "manuscript_title": "...",
  "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "overall_score": 72,
  "verdict": "REVISE",
  "fatal_count": 0,
  "major_count": 3,
  "minor_count": 4,
  "issues": [
    {
      "id": "M1",
      "severity": "major",
      "category": "C",
      "category_name": "Validation & Stats",
      "location": "Methods, paragraph 5",
      "description": "Calibration plot and Brier score absent for prediction model",
      "fixable_by_ai": true,
      "suggested_fix": "Add calibration analysis paragraph after discrimination results. Generate calibration plot via /make-figures."
    },
    {
      "id": "m1",
      "severity": "minor",
      "category": "F",
      "category_name": "Reporting Completeness",
      "location": "Abstract, line 3",
      "description": "Abstract reports AUC 0.91 but Table 2 shows 0.912 -- rounding inconsistency",
      "fixable_by_ai": true,
      "suggested_fix": "Change abstract to match table: AUC 0.91 (95% CI: 0.87-0.95)"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Field definitions:**
- `overall_score`: Integer 0-100 reflecting manuscript submission readiness
- `verdict`: `"PASS"` (score >= 85, no fatal issues) or `"REVISE"`
- `severity`: `"fatal"`, `"major"`, or `"minor"`
- `category`: Letter code from the 10-category system (A-J)
- `fixable_by_ai`: `true` if the issue can be resolved by editing manuscript text with existing data; `false` if it requires new data, analyses, or human judgment (e.g., design changes, IRB decisions, missing experiments)
- `requires_reanalysis` *(optional, default `false`)*: `true` when closing the finding needs a **committed analysis re-run against the real data**, not a prose edit — power/MDE re-simulation under the full model, first-visit/one-record-per-subject dedup, an extended- or reduced-adjustment sensitivity model, optimism correction of calibration. Always implies `fixable_by_ai: false`. Additive and backwards-compatible; parsers that do not expect it must ignore it. Route these to `/analyze-stats` (see Phase 4).
- `suggested_fix`: Specific, actionable instruction. If `fixable_by_ai` is true, this must be concrete enough for the fixer to execute without ambiguity.
- `consensus` *(optional, panel mode only)*: array of reviewer ids that raised the issue, e.g. `["R1","R3"]`. Additive and backwards-compatible — present only when Phase 2.6 ran; parsers that do not expect it must ignore it.
- `action` *(optional, editorial-impression findings only)*: `"REMOVE" | "MOVE" | "TIGHTEN"` — the SUBTRACTION direction for a category-L finding (Phase 2.5g). Present alongside `issue_type: "editorial_impression"` and `subtype: <verdict>` (e.g. `HEDGE_REPEAT`). Additive and backwards-compatible; these are always `severity: "minor"`, never block, and are `fixable_by_ai: false` by default (except a redundant `HEDGE_REPEAT`, which `--fix` may collapse). Parsers that do not expect it must ignore it.

### Phase 4: Fix Support

#### Standard mode (no --fix flag)

After presenting the report, offer to help fix specific issues:
- Rewrite overclaiming sentences
- Draft missing limitation statements
- Suggest statistical additions (e.g., calibration analysis code via `/analyze-stats`)
- Draft intended use, decision-impact, or novelty-delta statements
- Check specific tables/figures for consistency
- Generate missing flow diagrams via `/make-figures`

**`requires_reanalysis` findings route to `/analyze-stats`, not a prose edit (observational/cohort).**
For cohort and observational manuscripts, the highest-value fixes are usually *data-level*: a
power/MDE re-simulation under the full primary model, a first-visit / one-record-per-subject dedup
sensitivity, an extended- or reduced-adjustment (over-adjustment) sensitivity model, or optimism
correction of calibration. These are **not** `fixable_by_ai` text edits — `--fix` is text-only and
will silently skip them. Tag each such finding `requires_reanalysis: true` and route it to
`/analyze-stats` for a committed script + CSV, then feed the regenerated numbers back into the
manuscript and re-run the relevant Phase 2.5 gate. Surface these explicitly to the author rather
than letting an auto-fix pass appear to "resolve" them.

#### Auto-fix mode (--fix flag)

When `--fix` is passed:

1. **Filter fixable issues**: Select all issues where `fixable_by_ai` is true.
2. **Apply fixes sequentially**: For each fixable issue, edit the manuscript file directly:
   - Text rewrites (overclaiming, missing sentences, terminology) → Edit in place
   - Missing reporting items (ethics statement, data availability) → Insert at suggested location
   - Numerical inconsistencies (abstract-table mismatch) → Correct to match tables
   - Do NOT attempt: new statistical analyses, new figures, design changes, IRB-dependent items, or any issue tagged `requires_reanalysis` (route those to `/analyze-stats`)
   - Do NOT invoke other skills (`/make-figures`, `/analyze-stats`) during fix — text edits only
3. **Report changes**: After all fixes, output a summary:
   ```
   ## Auto-Fix Summary
   - Fixed: {N} issues
   - Skipped (requires human): {M} issues
   - Changes: {list of id + one-line description of what was changed}
   ```
4. **Post-edit paren-span safety scan**: if any fix reduced em-dashes (e.g. a `— X —` appositive → `(X)`), run the parenthesis-span gate before re-review — a bulk conversion can pair two unrelated dashes across a sentence boundary and wrap a whole sentence (or an ordinal "Sixth, …" limitation) inside one parenthesis (paren-balanced, so a balance check misses it):

   ```bash
   python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/check_paren_spans.py" \
     --manuscript manuscript.md --out qc/paren_spans.json --strict
   ```

   `PAREN_SPAN_ORDINAL` / `PAREN_SPAN_SENTENCE` is a Major — undo or repair that conversion before continuing.
5. **Re-review**: Run Phase 2 (systematic check) again on the modified manuscript.
6. **Iterate**: If new fixable issues emerge, apply one more round (maximum 2 total fix iterations).
7. **Final output**: Regenerate the Phase 3 report and Phase 3c JSON with updated scores.

**Iteration limit**: Maximum 2 fix-and-re-review cycles. If the score has not reached "PASS" after 2 iterations, output the final report with remaining issues and flag: "Auto-fix limit reached. Remaining issues require human review."

## What This Skill Does NOT Do

- Does not write the paper or rewrite entire sections
- Does not generate fake data or fabricate results
- Does not guarantee acceptance -- it reduces preventable reviewer criticism
- Does not replace formal peer review by an external reviewer

## Tone

Be direct and practical. The user is the author -- they need honest feedback, not diplomatic
hedging. Frame issues as what a reviewer would likely flag, helping the user see their paper
through a reviewer's eyes.

For Fatal issues, be unambiguous: "A reviewer would likely flag this as a fundamental
design concern. Submitting without addressing this risks Reject."

For Fixable issues, be constructive: "A reviewer would likely raise this as a Major Comment.
Here is how to address it with your existing data."

## Anti-Hallucination

- **Never fabricate references.** All citations must be verified via `/search-lit` with confirmed DOI or PMID. Mark unverified references as `[UNVERIFIED - NEEDS MANUAL CHECK]`. Self-review enforces this through **Phase 2.5c: Reference Hallucination Scan** (runs `/verify-refs` against the SSOT bib); any `FABRICATED` verdict blocks submission as a P0 Major Comment.
- **Never invent clinical definitions, diagnostic criteria, or guideline recommendations.** If uncertain, flag with `[VERIFY]` and ask the user.
- **Never fabricate numerical results** — compliance percentages, scores, effect sizes, or sample sizes must come from actual data or analysis output.
- If a reporting guideline item, journal policy, or clinical standard is uncertain, state the uncertainty rather than guessing.
